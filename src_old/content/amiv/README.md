## Update `About AMIV`

**IMPORTANT** Always edit both files at the same time. There must not be any mismatch in information between the two translations!

Please edit the files [`markdown/about.de.md`](markdown/about.de.md) and [`markdown/about.en.md`](markdown/about.en.md).

## Update the statutes

To update the statutes, regenerate the html file from the [LaTeX source](https://gitlab.ethz.ch/amiv/amiv-statuten) and exchange the file [`html/statutes.html`](html/statutes) with the newly generated version.
